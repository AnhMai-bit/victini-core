# DB Gateway

## Description

This is a simple gateway to a database. It is a simple REST API that allows you to perform CRUD operations on a database using GraphQL queries. It is written in Python and uses the Flask framework.

## Setup

- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the server: `python app.py`

## Usage

- The server will be running on `localhost:5000`
- To check if the database is connected, go to `localhost:5000/health`

Further documentation will be added soon.
